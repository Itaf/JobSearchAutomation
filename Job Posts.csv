TITLE:   Demographic Analysis Workshop
DURATION:  3 week
LOCATION:  Yerevan, Armenia
DESCRIPTION:   Demographic analysis and population projection represent
one of the cornerstones of public sector planning and private sector
market analysis at the national, regional, and local levels. Population
projections also provide the crucial denominator data needed for health
programs monitoring and evaluation. This workshop will strengthen the
participant's capacity: 
- to evaluate census, survey, and vital statistics data; 
- produce a consistent set of demographic estimates; 
- prepare national population projections for planning, monitoring, and
evaluation. 
The workshop will focus on the analysis of data from the 2001 census,
the 2000 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), vital statistics, and
other administrative data. However, special attention will be given to
the census and DHS data in order to maximize the timeliness and utility
of analytical products based on these data sources. Approximately two
days will be devoted to developing a design and outline for a 2001
census analytical report or series of reports. 
Participants will use the same U.S. Census Bureau and United Nations
demographic analysis and projection software used by staff of the Census
Bureau's International Programs Center to prepare estimates and
projections for the countries of Western Asia, including Armenia. 
REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS:  Participants should be mid-level professionals
(Statisticians and Demographers) who would directly use official census
and demographic survey data in their day-to-day work. This workshop
would be most beneficial for those who make or use population
projections. Participants should have a university degree and be
computer-literate, using PCs on a daily basis in a Windows environment.
English language is helpful, but not required. 
Individuals from government, private, and academic institutions are
sought. Participants from ministries such as Education, Health, or other
ministries that depend on demographic data are encouraged to apply.
Individuals from mass media or NGOs (unless specifically interested in
demography), would not be appropriate for this course. 
COURSE OVERVIEW:  This workshop will be taught by demographers from the
United States Census Bureau. The course will be taught in English, with
consecutive translation provided in Armenian. The course is offered free
to qualified candidates. No housing, travel, or per diem allowances are
available. 
This is a three-week course, starting March 9th and finishing on the
26th. Classes will be held Tuesday through Saturday, except for the last
and final week, when classes will be held Tuesday through Friday. A
one-hour break will be given for lunch, with coffee breaks during the
day as appropriate. Potential candidates must be able to make the
three-week commitment that this course requires-absences for more than a
day would not be acceptable. 
APPLICATION PROCEDURES:   If you are interested in this course and feel
you meet the qualifications stated above, please contact CRRC for an
application form or submit the attached application form via e-mail tocrrc@.... You will be notified by February 20th if you have been

policies and protocols and through pilot implementation of those new
approaches in Lori Marz. PRIME II's Human Immunodeficiency
Virus/Sexually Transmitted Infections (HIV/STI) project supports the
government of Armenia to strengthen its efforts to prevent further
spread of STIs in the population through preparing primary care
providers to offer integrated STI management and prevention services and
by educating communities around those primary care centers about
services and appropriate prevention practices. Since May, 2003 STI

105,"USAID, DCHA and LWVF
TITLE:   Annual Program Statement: Implementation and Extension of
Wheelchair Services
APS No. M/OP/DCHA/DOFDA-03-1344
DESCRIPTION:   The United States Government (USG), as represented by the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Bureau for
Democracy Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA), Leahy War Victims
Fund (LWVF) is seeking applications from US and non-US non-profit or
for-profit, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), international
organizations (IOs), and other qualified non-USG organizations (or
consortia) for the implementation and extension of wheelchair services
for civilian victims of war and other people with disabilities. This
program is authorized in accordance with the Foreign Assistance Act of
1961, as amended. Awards shall be made in accordance with 22 CFR 266,
OMB Circulars A-21 (for universities) or A-122 (for non-profit
organizations), ADS 303 and USAID Standard Provisions. 
For more than a decade, the WVF has maintained a primary objective of
expanding access to affordable and appropriate prosthetic and orthotic
services. Although much work remains to improve the quality, expand the
availability, and reduce the costs of prosthetic services, the Fund is
increasing its involvement in response to other challenges. The
overwhelming needs of persons requiring wheelchairs is one of those
challenges. 
Applicants under this APS should propose innovative ideas that address
the physical, social, and/or economic needs of persons requiring
wheelchairs. Prospective partners could include a wide range of U.S.,
international, and regional organizations such as: private voluntary
organizations, foundations, colleges and universities, civic groups,
faith-based institutions, private businesses and associations,
philanthropic organizations, and advocacy groups. The Bureau strongly
encourages U.S. organizations to collaborate with indigenous
organizations in their proposals. 
Organizations should already be registered with USAID. If not already
registered, U.S. PVOs can register athttp://www.usaid.gov/hum_response/pvc/regtoc.html, though the process
can be time consuming. Eligible Public International Organizations
(PIOs) can be found at http://www.usaid.gov/pubs/ads/300/30851m.pdf.
Host country-based NGOs should seek to register at the nearest USAID
Mission. 
USAID encourages qualified applicants to submit thoughtful and
innovative approaches that have high potential for successful
achievement of project objectives. Upon award, grants or cooperative
agreements will be managed/ monitored by either the DCHA Bureau in
Washington or field Missions, depending on the scope or nature of the
proposed activities. 
1. Introduction:  Conservative estimates put the number of people with
disabilities in developing countries at close to half a billion. Of
these, an estimated twenty million require wheelchairs to be mobile. 
While there are many humanitarian and development agencies involved in
prosthetics/orthotic programs, there are only a few who provide a
comprehensive approach to services for those requiring wheelchairs and
the associated training and education that must accompany their
provision. 
The statistics are startling: 
- UNESCO estimates that 20 million people in the world need a wheelchair
that don't have one; 
- The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that by the year 2020
road traffic accidents will account for the third highest cause of the
global burden of disease. This is a significant jump from its current
ranking of ninth. Developing countries will be largely responsible for
this sharp rise and many survivors may sustain mobility-related
injuries; 
- WHO data further suggest that between 20-40 people per million will
sustain a spinal cord injury in any one year, many of whom will be
confined to a wheelchair; 
- The incidence of cerebral palsy in the United States is about 1 in
93,000. In the developing world, the incidence is near 1 in 400 and many
with CP require wheelchairs for mobility; 
- Consensus estimates indicate that 26,000 people are killed or maimed
by land mines each year. Many of the injured will be wheelchair bound. 
Despite this overwhelming need, only a small percentage of people in the
developing world are able to obtain an appropriate wheelchair, the
requisite training needed to assist them to obtain their maximum
independence and functionality, and the opportunities to be contributing
members of their families, communities, and society. 
A wheelchair is more than just an aid to mobility. It can be a means to
self-sufficiency and increased self-esteem. It can be a vehicle to
meaningful employment and contributions to community and society. It
reduces dependency and the associated burden placed on family and
friends. 
Since 1989, the LWVF has invested significant resources in the
development and implementation of rehabilitation programs worldwide.
Several of these programs have included relatively minor wheelchair
provision and services activities. This APS represents a mechanism to
expand the scope of the activities specifically addressing the
comprehensive needs of persons requiring wheelchairs. 
2. Background:  Established in 1989, the Leahy War Victims Fund (LWVF),
administered by USAID, provides assistance to war victims in developing
countries. The Fund provides a dedicated source of financial and
technical assistance for civilian victims of war who suffer from
mobility-related injuries, including people who suffer from polio as a
result from interrupted immunization services. 
In the past decade, the Fund has devoted the major part of its resources
to the establishment and improvement of accessible and appropriate
prosthetic services. This decision was based upon the realization that
with its modest resources, the Fund would have the greatest impact on
the greatest number of people through the provision of ""unassisted
mobility."" The Fund also devotes substantial attention to ensure that
service providers incorporate appropriate follow up and monitoring of
beneficiaries of services. 
More recently the Fund has extended its scope selectively in response to
the needs of different populations of war victims. For instance, in some
countries there is a great need for rapid treatment of victims who
suffer general medical trauma from accidental detonation of unexploded
ordinance and less of a need for treatment of mine amputee victims.
Other LWVF responses include assistance to improve surgical preparation
for prosthetic fitting, strengthening organizations that address the
needs of PWDs, improved physical and occupational rehabilitation
services, and support for innovative approaches to increase
income-generating opportunities for war victims. 
The Leahy War Victims Fund has now provided over $ 90 million in more
than 22 countries in support of civilian victims of war. Detailed
descriptions of current country initiatives can be found athttp://www.leahywarvictimsfund.org/ Descriptions found at this web site
outline the scope of activities currently being funded through the Leahy
War Victims Fund. 
3. Program Components:  This Annual Program Statement may support
multiple activities that will be responsive to critical needs. However,
Leahy War Victims Fund philosophy must be foundational to the proposal: 
The LWVF believes that a number of fundamental principles should be
applied to the development and provision of wheelchairs and wheelchair
programming. 
First and foremost, like the provision of prostheses, providing
wheelchairs is not just about the chair itself. Rather, it is about
increasing the quality of a survivor's life through increased mobility,
independence and integration into society. When the wheelchair itself is
the focus, there is a great temptation for an organization to take a
""one size fits all"" approach and mass produce, or collect donated chairs
and conduct mass deliveries. Not only are these wheelchairs generally
ill-suited to the rough urban and rural environments of low-income
countries, but they do not provide long-term solutions, and have in some
cases, caused the collapse of local wheelchair manufacturing
enterprises. 
Second, while numerous non-governmental organizations endeavor to
provide wheelchairs, few attempt to establish indigenous wheelchair
production. While shipments of appropriate wheelchairs may provide a
short-term benefit to a small group of people, supporting local and
small-scale production of good quality, repairable, and affordable
chairs in country is better development practice. Similarly, regional
production coupled with local assembly and repair offers opportunities
for sustainability. 
Third, the usefulness of a wheelchair is directly related to the
training and expertise of the technician fitting the chair, proper
assessment and prescription, and basic training in safe and effective
use. 
Finally, the provision or use of a wheelchair is only a beginning step
to enabling a wheelchair user to improve their quality of life and play
a role within their community. Greater investments still need to be made
in local disabled people's organizations and self-help groups, increased
opportunities need to be provided to attend school and be active in the
workplace, and increased advocacy on a local and national level needs to
take place. 
4. Funding Available, Number of Awards and Types of Assistance:  This is
an open Annual Program Statement (APS) under which USAID solicits
proposals from organizations that are interested in addressing the
diverse needs of people requiring wheelchairs in the developing world.
Proposals will be reviewed by USAID using the process described below. 
Funding Available and Number of Awards: The actual number of awards
under this APS is subject to the availability of funds and the viability
of proposals received. Accordingly, USAID reserves the right to make
multiple grants or no awards at all through this APS. LWVF is a
worldwide program and may fund programs in any of the USAID regions:
Africa, Latin American and Caribbean, Europe and Eurasia, and Asia and
Near East. Preference will be given to applications for programs in
countries that already receive USAID funding (disaster or development
assistance). No award will be made without the concurrence of the USAID
mission or Embassy in the country under consideration. Subject to the
foregoing, USAID is planning for a program of up to $5 million over five
years, beginning in FY 2003. The Bureau is open to working with both
large and small organizations, organizations with both experience and no
experience in working with the U.S. government or USAID. Grant requests
should generally range from $50,000 to $500,000 per year. Proposals may
be for as little as one year and up to a maximum of five years.
Proposals for less than that amount may be acceptable, but must
demonstrate a high priority, as well as targeted, rapid, and lasting
impact. 
USAID shall not be liable for any costs incurred by applicants in
preparation and submission of concept papers or applications. 
USAID reserves the right to award cooperative agreements instead of
grants if deemed more desirable or appropriate. If USAID elects to award
a cooperative agreement instead of a grant, a cooperative agreement will
permit the ""substantial involvement"" of USAID in program activities.
Specifically, USAID substantial involvement will involve the approval
of: (a) annual work plans; (b) not more than five (5) key personnel
appointments; (c) program monitoring and evaluation plans; (d)
subcontracts and subagreements and subcontractors/subrecipients; and (e)
agreement in the selection of advisory committee members, if applicable.
Financial reporting will depend on the payment provisions of the
cooperative agreement(s), which cannot be determined until the
successful applicant(s) is(are) selected. In no case, however, will
financial reporting be required more frequently than progress reporting.
Such reporting will be quarterly, with reports due 30 days after the end
of each calendar quarter. Final progress reports will be due 90 days
after the expiration of the cooperative agreement(s). 
5. Application Process:  Applicants shall submit an original and two (2)
copies of the Technical Application and an original and one (1) copy of
the Cost Application. An electronic copy of both the technical and cost
applications must also be provided on a 3.5"" disk (MS Word or Excel
format). 
Applications must be submitted in English. Unnecessarily elaborate
brochures or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a
complete and effective application are not desired and may be construed
as an indication of the prospective recipient's lack of cost
consciousness. Elaborate artwork, expensive paper and bindings and
expensive visual and other presentation aids are neither necessary nor
desired. 
Applicants must be submitted in accordance with the requirements set
forth below: 
Application Instructions 
a. All applications must be in size 12 font, New Times Roman.

is recommend that the applicant contact USAID in advance of any courier
delivery to ensure that someone will be available to receive the
application, which cannot be left unattended at the guard station.
Electronic transmittal of the final application (including budget and
budget narrative) shall also constitute an official submission, but
USAID does not accept any responsibility for delays in transmission or
receipt. 
From among the applications, USAID will select those that it intends to
fund and will proceed to negotiate an award with each successful
applicant subject to the availability of funding. The final decision for
funding will be based on both a technical review and the availability of
USAID funding. USAID reserves the right to fund one or more or none of
the applications that may be submitted. All applications will be
evaluated according to the criteria below. 
Note that all applicants may be subject to a pre-award financial review.
Further, organizations that believe they may not meet USAID's financial
accountability requirements are encouraged to submit their proposal in
partnership with eligible U.S. or international, or regional
organizations that are experienced with these requirements in order to
promote sustainability of programs after USAID support ends. 
6. Review and Evaluation Process:  USAID will review all applications
submitted prior to COB August 12, 2004 in an initial round of reviews.
Applications submitted after August 12, 2004 will be reviewed
approximately on a quarterly basis until January 31, 2005.

Potential partners include: private voluntary organizations,
foundations, colleges and universities, civic groups, faith-based
institutions, international organizations, private businesses and
associations, regional organizations, philanthropic organizations, and
advocacy groups. Potential for-profit applicants should note that USAID
policy prohibits the payment of fee/profit to the prime recipient under
grants and cooperative agreements. Forgone profit does not qualify as
cost sharing or leveraging. Note that the preceding list of potential
partners is for illustrative purposes only, as our criteria for
eligibility are broad. USAID welcomes other, new types of partners. 
USAID encourages proposals that embrace our Global Development Alliance
- a USAID initiative that seeks to leverage USG funds by matches from
private sources, preferably not less than 1:1. To be counted as a GDA
initiative, there must be a clear expectation that USAID resources will
be at least matched one-to-one by all other resources combined, both
public (e.g., official, bilateral, multilateral, or governmental) and
private (e.g., from companies, foundations, universities, NGOs, or
individuals), so long as private resources equal at least 25% of USAID's
contribution. 
Applications are not required to include cost-sharing provisions.
Applications that include additional in-kind and/or cash contributions
from non-U.S. government sources will, however, be give special
consideration since cost sharing demonstrates a strong commitment to the
proposed program. Cost sharing includes contributions, both cash and
in-kind, which are necessary and reasonable to achieve program
objectives and which are verifiable from the recipient's records. Cost
sharing contributions may include volunteer services provided by
professional and technical personnel, and un-recovered indirect costs.
However, cost sharing does not include forgone profit. Applicants that
do not include such contributions are encouraged to provide a rationale
for not doing so. 
Program Eligibility Criteria 
To be considered for funding under this APS, proposed programs must meet
all of the following requirements: 
- Proposals must have clearly-defined objectives that lead to
empirically verifiable results through an effective methodology 
- Proposals should reflect some combination of the following factors;
expertise and/or experience, innovative and new ideas, effective use of
technologies 
- Proposals must address one or more of the priorities and concerns
listed earlier in this APS 
- Proposals must offer promise of significant development impact, as
measured, for example, by the number of direct and indirect
beneficiaries of the program, and/or by the potential for replication or
scaling-up over time 
- Proposals must be feasible from a technical, economic, financial, and
social perspective 
Selection Criteria for Applications 
The criteria listed below will serve as the basis upon which all
applications will be evaluated. Technical aspects of the applications,
evaluated according to the criteria below, will constitute 40 points of
the total evaluation, and must demonstrate the likelihood that the
proposed program will be successful in achieving its objectives.
Applicants' organizational experience, past performance, and quality of
key staff will constitute 40 points of the evaluation; this will include
an assessment of the applicants' ability to achieve expected results
within a reasonable time frame. The remaining 20 points will be based on
fairness and reasonableness of costs. 
1. Technical Approach - 40 points 
Applications shall have a clear definition of the problem which the
grant activity intends to address, supported by reliable data and
consultations with the local communities and appropriate host country
organizations to the extent necessary; clearly define the nature of
intervention/s that will be provided and strongly establish the
relationship of these interventions with defined problem; interventions
must focus on problem solving rather than simply problem identification.
The application shall have a strong likelihood of appropriate
sustainability with a sensible scheme for addressing this concern. USAID
will look for evidence of broad-based local support, including evidence
of significant local contributions from participant ""stakeholders"" as
well as other entities that are sympathetic with the proposed activity.
Further, applications shall have an evaluation and reporting plan
incorporating such critical elements as: impact indicators,
gender-disaggregated data collection, monitoring, program audit,
preparation of financial status reports, and progress reports. USAID
will give priority to applications that demonstrate innovative
approaches in reaching and engaging the participation of target
beneficiaries, host country agencies, and other stakeholders as well as
incorporate, as appropriate, a well defined system for selecting
developing and strengthening the organizational and management
capabilities of local communities and counterpart agencies. 
2. Institutional Qualifications/Past Performance/Personnel - 40 points 
Applications will be evaluated on both past performance as well as
program intentions. Applications should demonstrate a thoroughness and
understanding of management principles, technically sound planning and
operations management, and the capabilities necessary to successfully
manage the program; including USAID regulations. If a sub-grant
mechanism is proposed, the applicant must demonstrable the ability to
manage and implement such a program. Proposed key staff should have
successful, verifiable, and recent experience and there should be
demonstrable experience in developing and sustaining effective,
collaborative work with grant stakeholders, other organizations, and
host country representatives. Previous experience in the development and
implementation of strategies that contribute to the functional
reintegration of people with disabilities, especially those requiring
wheelchairs, will be appropriately recognized 
3. Cost Considerations - 20 points 
Applications will be evaluated on both the fairness and reasonableness
of all proposed costs, cost sharing and the extent to which local buy-in
(not necessarily financial) is demonstrated. 
USAID reserves the right to make multiple grants or no awards at all
through this APS. Programs selected for funding will be based on the
score of the technical evaluations, evidence or organizational
responsibility, USAID priorities, ability and willingness of concerned
USAID Missions to award and manage the activity, and the availability of
funds. If the results of USAID's assessment are not positive, written
notification will be provided to the applicant. If the results are
positive, the selected organization will be notified. Additional
information and program revisions may be required.

TITLE:   NGO Training on the Framework Convention for the Protection of
National Minorities
NGO Training on the Council of Europe's Framework Convention for the
Protection of National Minorities 
DURATION:   27-30 May 2004
LOCATION:   Strasbourg, France 
DESCRIPTION:   As part of ongoing work on the Framework Convention for
the Protection of National Minorities, Minority Rights Group
International is organising a Training on the Framework Convention for
the Protection of National Minorities. The training is organised in
cooperation with the FCNM Secretariat of the Directorate General of
Human Rights of the Council of Europe, and will be held in Strasbourg
from 27th to 30th May 2004. The training is for minority based and
interethnic human rights NGOs from countries whose state reports are due
in 2004 only. The training is open to NGOs from Armenia, Austria,
Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany,
Hungary, Italy, Liechtenstein, Macedonia, Malta, Moldova, Romania,
Russian Federation, San Marino, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain,
Ukraine, and United Kingdom. The training is also open to NGOs from
Kosovo. 
The objectives of the training will be to: 
- Provide information on the content of the Framework Convention and its
monitoring mechanism; 
- Identify ways in which NGOs can best contribute to the monitoring of
the implementation of the Convention, both at the domestic level and at
the level of the Council of Europe; 
- Provide opportunities for participating NGOs to make contact with
other NGOs working on minority protection, Council of Europe staff,
members of the treaty monitoring body, and their government
representatives to the Council of Europe; and 
- Develop follow-up activities, focusing on involvement in state
reporting process, producing shadow reports, and related advocacy. 
The programme will include presentations, case studies, discussions,
small group and individual work. It will include an overview of
international instruments and mechanisms for minority protection,
including in-depth consideration of the Framework Convention, its
monitoring mechanism and opportunities for civil society to contribute.
Methodologies will be participatory and the focus will be on practice.
There will be task groups on the development of NGO advocacy strategies
to contribute to effective monitoring of State compliance and drafting
additional information/shadow reports. 
MRG will invite representatives of 25 NGOs from the target countries
listed above. 
Participants will be selected on the basis of their organisations'
institutional capacity and commitment to raise awareness of minority
rights and monitor implementation of international instruments,
specifically the Framework Convention, and their own professional
experience. 
Priority will be given to NGOs who: 
- Prioritise advocacy for protection of minority rights (international
experience is not needed, but experience and organisational commitment
to working on minority protection at the domestic level is key) 
- Are interested in producing shadow reports on the Framework Convention
and being involved in the state reporting process. 
NGO representatives applying to the training have to be staff members of
their organisations, and should have: 
- Experience in advocacy work; 
- Commitment to human and minority rights; 
- In-principle support from the management of their organisation to take
forward work on monitoring the Framework Convention; 
- Very good English language skills. Unfortunately, the budget does not
allow for interpretation costs and therefore participants should have
very good English language skills to be able to participate actively in
discussions. 
MRG will aim for a mixture of people from different countries, at least
70% of whom will be from minority communities, and a gender balance. MRG
will select participants on the basis of their application and the above
organisational and professional selection criteria. 
MRG will not select more than one participant from any one organisation.
The training is not open to organisations from which 2 or more persons
have participated in MRG's Strasbourg FCNM training since 2000. Anyone
not sure how many persons from their organisation have participated in
MRG's previous FCNM trainings can contact MRG to double check.

TITLE:   Small Grants Pilot Projects on Human Rights Education
LOCATION:  Budapest, Hungary
DESCRIPTION:   Financial assistance in support of local pilot projects
is important to the Youth Programme on Human Rights Education because it
will allow for new initiatives to be set up and will motivate supporting
local NGOs and groups to undertake action related to human rights
education with young people. By funding pilot projects on human rights
education through the European Youth Foundation, the Directorate of
Youth and Sport seeks to actively contribute to the inclusion of human
rights education in youth work practice and to encourage innovative
practices and partnerships, both in formal and in non-formal education
contexts. 
The pilot projects will allow for a more visible and direct impact of
the programme at local level. They are a necessary complement to the
rest of the youth programme on human rights education and to the other
activities of the Directorate of Youth and Sport of the Council of
Europe. 
Similarly, the inclusion of pilot projects in the European programme may
serve to give them greater visibility and recognition, as well as
facilitating the development of networks and of opportunities to share
expertise and experiences. This will be done by means of the Directorate
of Youth and Sport publications and web sites. This may be completed by
an evaluation meeting and a publication with examples of good practice
in 2005. 
This financial support to pilot projects should be seen as exceptional
and limited to the duration of the programme. The European funding can
not replace the necessary local and/or national co-funding (in money or
in kind). In this context, the assessment of applications will consider
also the feasibility of the projects. 
Priority for funding will be given to projects which would otherwise be
difficult to start up. Funding will not be given to projects that have
already taken place. 
In order to qualify for support, projects must: 
- Be directly related to young people and to human rights education or
to a specific theme addressed by the programme; 
- Be prepared, run and managed by a local association, institution or
youth group acting directly with children, young people or a specific
target group of the programme; 
- Have a clear educational or awareness-raising function; 
- Concern primarily participants under 30 years of age; 
- Have a participatory approach, from the conception to the evaluation; 
- Integrate intercultural learning in its educational approach; 
- Have an innovative character (in terms of methodology, target groups
addressed, etc.); 
- Be open to other partners of the youth programme on human rights
education and foresee using the resources generated through the
programme (e.g. the Manual on Human Rights Education); 
- Have a clear potential local impact while being open to European
networks; 
- Have a European dimension, either by involving more than one country,
and/or by taking into consideration the European context; 
- Follow the basic educational principles of the Council of Europe's
youth sector. 
Selected projects can be funded up to a maximum of 7.600 Euro.
